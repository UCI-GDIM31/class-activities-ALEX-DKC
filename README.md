I belong to Table 5, and I will be answering question 1.
Q: You¡¯re building a rhythm game, and you¡¯re writing a method named DidPlayerHitBeat that tells you whether or not the player accurately hit a beat based on the time that they pressed a key.
The input will include float x and float y. Float x refers to the moment when player's finger touches the screen. Float y refers to the moment when player's finger leaves the screen. In the body part of the method, we will substract y from x to obtain float z. If z is greater than 0.2s, then bool whetherHit equals true. The boolean type whetherHit variable will be the output.
Input: float x (touch time); float y (leave time)
Output type: boolean
